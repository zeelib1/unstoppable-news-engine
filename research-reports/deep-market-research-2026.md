**Quote #2: Vibe Coding CRM**
> "@arram lol. It's funny because the Hub Spot founder has been recently 'educating' people on why they don't want to vibe code their CRM. It's sooooooo complicated. I'm over 6 months into coding and it's the one thing I look at (CRM's) and say 'that's going to be simple'"

**Quote #3: Cost**
> "Not worth the battle, IMO. I don't think most people realize how damn expensive it is to run a legit business. Good materials, the right insurance, paying your guys well, all the systems (CRM, marketing, etc.)"
