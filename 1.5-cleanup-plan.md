# GitHub Cleanup Plan for AskFiles Pivot

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Goal:** Archive blog platform work, prepare for AskFiles MVP

---

## Steps to Execute

### 1. Tag Current State (Preserve Blog Work)
```bash
cd /root/ejaj-media
git tag -a blog-platform-v1 -m "Blog platform before AskFiles pivot"
git push origin blog-platform-v1
```

### 2. Close Blog-Related Issues
Close with message: 
> "Closing as part of product pivot to AskFiles (document knowledge base). Blog platform work preserved in `blog-platform-v1` tag for future reference."

Issues to close: #45-97 (all blog features/tests/docs)

### 3. Delete Unmerged Blog Branches
```bash
# Delete local branches
git branch -D feature/issue-72 feature/issue-75 fix/issue-78

# Delete remote branches  
git push origin --delete feature/issue-72
git push origin --delete feature/issue-75
git push origin --delete fix/issue-78
```

### 4. Create AskFiles Milestone
```bash
# In GitHub UI:
- Create milestone: "AskFiles MVP v1.0"
- Target date: February 7, 2026 (10 days)
```

### 5. Create AskFiles Issues
New issues for the actual MVP:

**Backend (Laravel):**
- [ ] #98: Create `knowledge_bases` migration & model
- [ ] #99: Create `document_chunks` migration (metadata)
- [ ] #100: Add OpenAI embeddings service
- [ ] #101: Add Qdrant integration service
- [ ] #102: Implement upload endpoint (POST /knowledge-bases)
- [ ] #103: Implement search endpoint (GET /knowledge-bases/:id/search)
- [ ] #104: Integrate Docling document processing
- [ ] #105: Add chunking logic (500-1000 char chunks)

**Frontend (Nuxt):**
- [ ] #106: Create upload page with drag-drop
- [ ] #107: Create processing indicator
- [ ] #108: Create search page (/:kb_id)
- [ ] #109: Create search results display with citations
- [ ] #110: Mobile responsive design

**DevOps:**
- [ ] #112: Configure Caddy with SSL

- [ ] #117: E2E test (upload → search flow)

---

## Execution Time

- Tagging: 1 minute
- Closing issues: 5 minutes (bulk close via gh CLI)
- Deleting branches: 2 minutes
- Creating new issues: 10 minutes

**Total: ~20 minutes**

---

## What Gets Preserved

All blog work is saved:
- ✅ Git history intact
- ✅ Tagged as `blog-platform-v1`
- ✅ Can checkout anytime: `git checkout blog-platform-v1`
- ✅ All code files remain (not deleted)

Only cleaning:
- ❌ Old issue tracker entries
- ❌ Unmerged branches
- ❌ Outdated roadmap

---

## After Cleanup

Repository will contain:
- **Codebase:** Laravel API + Nuxt frontend (reusable)
- **Docling pipeline:** Fully intact (we need this!)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Qdrant, performance improvements
- **Issues:** Only AskFiles MVP tasks
- **Branches:** Only `main` and active work branches

**Ready to build AskFiles without confusion.**
