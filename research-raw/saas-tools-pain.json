      "text": "Scoring and prioritising leads in a small aviation business does not require a big, expensive CRM system. In fact, many flying clubs, flight schools, charter operators, and maintenance organisations already have most of the data they need. It is usually just scattered across inboxes, forms, spreadsheets, and booking tools.\n\nLead scoring simply means deciding which enquiries deserve attention first, and which ones can wait or be handled automatically. When done well, it reduces response time for high value prospects, avoids wasting time on poor fits, and creates a calmer, more predictable sales and onboarding process.\n\nWhy lead scoring matters in aviation\n\nAviation businesses deal with very different types of leads. A student pilot asking about trial flights is very different from an operator enquiring about block charter hours, or an aircraft owner asking for long term maintenance support. Treating every enquiry the same leads to rushed decisions, missed follow ups, and constant interruptions.\n\nLead scoring gives structure to this. Even a simple system helps you answer three questions immediately:\nWho should I respond to first?\nWhat kind of response do they need?\nWhat should happen next if I do not respond right away?\n\nStarting simple without a CRM\n\nYou do not need Salesforce or HubSpot for this. Many aviation SMBs start with nothing more than:\nAn online enquiry form\nAn email inbox\nA spreadsheet or lightweight database\nAn automation tool such as Make\n\nThe key is capturing a few useful signals when someone first gets in touch. For example:\nType of enquiry (training, charter, maintenance, membership)\nUrgency (immediate, this month, just researching)\nBudget or aircraft type\nHow they found you\nWhether they have flown before or own an aircraft\n\nEach of these can contribute to a basic score.\n\nAn example for a flight school\n\nImagine a flight school with an online contact form. You ask:\nAre you looking for a trial flight, licence training, or advanced ratings?\nWhen would you like to start?\nHave you flown before?\n\nBehind the scenes, you can assign simple values:\nAdvanced ratings enquiry = high score\nStart within 30 days = high score\nPrevious flying experience = medium score\n\nUsing Make, you can automatically:\nReceive the form submission\nCalculate a total score based on answers\nTag the lead as High, Medium, or Low priority\nStore it in a Google Sheet or Airtable\nSend a tailored reply\n\nHigh priority leads get a personal email with availability and a phone call reminder sent to your team. Medium priority leads get a helpful information pack and an invitation to book a call. Low priority leads get an automated welcome email and are added to a follow up sequence that checks in after a week or two.\n\nNo CRM required, but the behaviour is the same as professional sales systems.\n\nCharter and aircraft services use case\n\nFor charter operators or maintenance organisations, lead scoring is often about aircraft size, scope, and seriousness.\n\nAn enquiry mentioning urgent AOG support, turbine aircraft, or recurring charter work should not sit in the same queue as a vague availability question.\n\nYou can score based on:\nAircraft type\nLocation\nUrgency\nMention of contracts or ongoing work\nOut of hours request\n\nAutomation can then route high scoring leads to immediate notifications via email or internal messaging, while lower scoring enquiries receive an acknowledgement and are processed during normal business hours.\n\nThis alone reduces stress on staff and ensures valuable opportunities are handled promptly.\n\nUsing simple tools you may already have\n\nMany aviation businesses already use:\nGoogle Forms or website forms\nShared inboxes\nScheduling tools\nAccounting or booking software\n\nMake can connect these without changing your core systems. For example:\nWebsite form submission triggers a scoring scenario\nScores and notes are written into a spreadsheet\nThe spreadsheet update triggers different email templates\nCalendar reminders are created for follow ups\nA summary is sent to the owner or ops manager once per day\n\nThe result is a quiet, orderly flow of information instead of reactive inbox checking.\n\nGradually adding more intelligence\n\nOnce the basics are working, you can layer on more advanced logic:\nIncrease lead score if they open emails or book a call\nDecrease score if there is no response after multiple follow ups\nRoute certain lead types directly into booking workflows\nSync high quality leads into a lightweight CRM or customer database\nGenerate reports that show enquiry quality by source\n\nFor flying clubs, this can help identify which marketing activities attract committed members rather than casual browsers. For schools, it clarifies which channels produce students who actually start training. For maintenance shops, it highlights repeat aircraft owners vs one off requests.\n\nThe real benefit: less noise, better focus\n\nLead scoring is not about pushing sales harder. It is about protecting your time and your team’s attention. In aviation, interruptions cost more than just efficiency. They affect safety culture, customer perception, and staff workload.\n\nBy letting automation handle sorting, tagging, and responding to enquiries, you create space for human judgement where it matters most: building relationships, planning operations, and delivering safe, high quality service.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed by enquiries but know not all of them deserve the same effort, lead scoring is one of the highest leverage automations you can implement. Start small, keep it simple, and let the system grow with your business.",

      "text": "5 Key Reasons to Invest in Software;\n\n1. Software has become the operational core of companies\nIt is no longer a support function, but a critical infrastructure (ERP, CRM, data, security, workflow). Replacing these systems is expensive, risky and time-consuming, which creates high switching costs and stable revenues.\n\n2. AI enhances the value of the best platforms, not displaces them\n2024-2025 showed that AI does not destroy SaaS, but rewards platforms with proprietary data, distribution and integration into workflows. Providers that build AI into the core product win.\n\n3. Structural productivity growth is now measurable\nCompanies are actually achieving more with fewer employees. Software is the main channel for monetizing this productivity, which supports IT budgets in the long term even in a slower macro environment.\n\n4. High free cash flow and scalability\nThe best software companies generate 25-40% free cash flow, have low marginal costs and global scalability, which makes them resilient to inflation and capital disciplined.\n\n5. Geopolitical and cyber realities increase demand\nFragmentation of the world, data regulation and the growth of cyber threats increase the strategic importance of software (security, compliance, data governance), which creates long-term, non-cyclical demand.\n\nSoftware is no longer a “bet on growth”, but a strategic allocation of capital into the digital infrastructure of the modern economy. Artificial intelligence is a catalyst, not a threat; the quality of the platform, data and cash flows is becoming decisive.",
