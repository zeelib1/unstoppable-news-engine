      "text": "4 biggest reasons why SEO agencies switch from Semrush to @sitecheckerpro\n\n(we analyzed dozens of closed-won deals)\n\n1/ It became too expensive\n\n- Invited user costs $45 each\n- Invited user to the AI visibility toolkit costs $99 each, additionally\n\nThe monthly price for a team with 10+ projects often ends with $700-$1k. Sitechecker is x2 cheaper and doesn’t charge for invited users at all.\n\n2/ It lacks real GSC / GA4 insights\n\nSemrush connects to GSC and GA4, but it doesn’t think with that data. It doesn’t have actionable reports that will show you low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe real insights are born:\n\n- when you merge GSC and GA4 in one report\n- when you combine its data with content changes / new pages tracking\n- when you find a unique way to visualise data by pages, segments\n- when you give additional options to work with this data, which native GSC / GA4 interfaces don’t have \n\n3/ It has non-reliable AI visibility tracking\n\n“Semrush has built an AI visibility tool very fast, but at what cost… The interface and functionality are very basic, and the data is far from accurate.” (quote from a user on one of the calls)\n\nYes, it’s hard to compare the accuracy of AI tracking tools. It’s not a static Google SERP, and the level of personalization is much higher, but people compare multiple tools for this purpose and have a feeling of what works better.\n\nThe problem is that SEMrush does not live up to its status as a market leader, does not keep up with changes, and users worry about what will happen next.\n\n4/ It has too limited support or no support at all\n\nAt their help center, you can either book a sales call or have to find the answer yourself. This one hurts the most when you’re an agency. \n\nYou don’t have the luxury of “we’ll get back to you”. You need fast answers, even if the answer is “here’s a workaround”.\n\nHave you ever confused by any of these 4 things while using Semrush?\n\nIf yes, try Sitechecker for free or ask for a demo in the replies.",

      "text": "Shopify SEO Secrets: Rank #1 in 90 Days (Without Gurus)\n\nMost Shopify stores don’t fail because SEO is complicated.\n\nThey fail because they waste months doing SEO that doesn’t move revenue an inch.\nI’ve seen this play out again and again.\n\nI’ve helped rank over 20 Shopify stores, and the pattern is always the same:\n\nGreat products, clean design, but no real SEO strategy.\nThe problem isn’t effort.\nIt’s focus.\n\n1. From Page Views to Paying Customers\n\nMost Shopify SEO fails at step one.\nPeople target keywords with big numbers because they look impressive.\n\nBut “wireless headphones” doesn’t pay the bills.\n“wireless headphones under $200 for gaming” does.\n]\nHere is what works in real life:\n-Collection pages target buyer-intent keywords\n-Product pages go after highly specific searches\n-Blogs support those pages, not the other way around\n\nOne store I worked with ignored a 90k/month keyword and focused on a long, ugly phrase no one was excited about.\n\nThat single keyword now drives consistent sales every week.\n\nWhen one of my clients switched from broad terms to buyer-intent phrases, their traffic numbers didn’t explode overnight… but their revenue did. Fewer visitors, more orders. That’s the game.\n\nAsk yourself:\n“If someone types this keyword, are they researching, or are they ready to buy?”\n\nMost stores treat collection pages like a product list.\nThat quietly kills sales.\n\n2. Your collection pages are quietly killing your revenue\n\nMost brands obsess over product pages and treat collection pages like a boring product list.\n\nThat’s a mistake.\nCollection pages are where Google and serious buyers figure out if you’re the real deal.\n\nWhat works insanely well:\n\n-Clean URLs: https://t.co/k3WLrekRZO\n-Strong titles: Hair Gel for Men – Strong Hold & Clean Finish –   BrandName\n-Short buying guides, comparisons, and FAQs right on the page\n\nOne Hair Gel brand I worked with simply added a short “How to choose your first hair gel” guide on their collection page.\n\nResult: jumped to page 1, and those pages started printing money.\n\nYour collection pages shouldn’t just display products.\nThey should sell the category.\n\n3. Technical SEO isn’t a PhD subject\n\nA lot of store owners freeze here and think, “This is too technical.”\n\nIt really isn’t.\nFocus on three basics:\n\n- Simple site structure (no page should be buried 5 clicks deep)\n- Fast load times (compress images, remove junk apps)\n- A mobile experience that doesn’t make people pinch and zoom like it’s 2012\n\nI have seen stores rank better just by removing junk apps, fixing mobile issues, and loading in under 3 seconds.\n\nNo tricks.\nJust basics done right.\nContent that actually sells, not just fills a blog\nRandom blog posts don’t build authority.\nStrategic content does.\n\nThink in funnels:\n\n-TOFU (Discover): How to build a simple skincare routine for oily skin\n-MOFU (Compare): Vitamin C vs niacinamide: which is better for oily skin?\n-BOFU (Buy): Best vitamin C serum for oily skin by [Your Brand\n\nEach piece should link deeper into your store:\nBlog → Collection → Product → Complementary product.\n\nWhen we built content like this for a skin care brand, they stopped being “just another store” and became the skin care authority. Guess who Google prefers to rank?\n\nBut SEO takes too long…\nThat’s the biggest pushback I hear.\n\nHere’s the truth:\nYes, SEO is not “post today, profit tomorrow.”\n\nBut 90 days is enough to see clear movement if you follow a focused process:\n\nMonth 1: Fix structure, on-page, and core technical issues\nMonth 2: Launch strategic content and internal linking\nMonth 3: Build a handful of quality backlinks and refine what’s working\n\nYou don’t wait a year to see movement.\n\nMost stores start seeing real traction within 60–90 days, not magic rankings, but enough momentum to know it’s working.\n\nThe stores that say “SEO doesn’t work” usually quit right before it does.",
