      "text": "Too many politicians mistake good optics for good leadership. They measure success by headlines, polls, and social media hype instead of outcomes. \n\nPR feels safer. It avoids risk. It keeps everyone smiling, at least for a news cycle. \n\nBut governing isn’t theater. It’s decision-making under pressure, often when no option looks good at first glance.\n\nWeaker politicians confuse explanation with permission. They wait to see how something will play before acting, and by then the moment has passed. \n\nLeadership works the opposite way. You act based on principle, evidence, and responsibility. Then you explain. Clearly. Honestly. In language people can understand.\n\nThe public doesn’t need perfection or spin. It needs coherence. Do the right thing, accept the consequences, and communicate like an adult. \n\nThat’s not bad PR. \nThat’s leadership.",
