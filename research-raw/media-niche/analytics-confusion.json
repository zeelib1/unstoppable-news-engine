Many other games target this audience.\nBut then it's catastrophically missing features that a competitive audience would need and be interested in.\n\nNo text chat, no scoreboard, can't ping on the Map, mini compass without degree numbers, No U.I Settings at all, forced motion blur on equipment, A sens slider from hell (you can't enter numbers, only move the slider. the sens range is completely outdated. It goes from 0 to 10 and 1 is 20cm/360 on 800DPI, so at higher DPI's it becomes unusable. The ADS sens has some obtuse ratio. I think it's 1:3 but am i correct ? who knows) No hold for crouch, no toggle for ads,  no analytical tools whatsoever (no stats, Map preview, relevant post match info), no anonymous and streamer mode, no input selector for your microphone.\n\nAnd these are just the things i am remembering after yesterday. I didn't even keep a list while playing and i usually don't even play ranked.\n\nThis is NOT a post about the gameplay or performance or anything else. I am NOT trashing the game as a whole. I actually think people are dismissing it way too early and it got some really incredible foundations, with some sick gameplay.\n\nThis post is only about the utter confusion i have about the seeming focus on a specific audience in it's broad strokes and then a completely lack of attention to that audience in other important aspects.",
