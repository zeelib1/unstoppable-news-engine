These barriers do not protect investors. They quietly exclude them and keep global capital locked out of opportunity.",

It’s fixing one of the most broken and expensive ones in finance.\n\nFinancial institutions spend $200–$280B every year on onboarding, KYC, and compliance.\n\nFor big banks, that’s already 5–8% of their budget. For fintechs and stablecoin-native players? It’s way worse:\n\n20–25% of total operating costs burned on compliance and identity.\n\nCompliance has become a regressive tax\nespecially for stablecoin startups.\n\nDeFi composability allows stablecoin neobanks to stack:\n• onramps\n• cards\n• virtual accounts\n• financial modules\n\n…all under one interface.\nBut the whole thing breaks the moment users have to re-KYC every time they switch a module.\n\nMainstream users won’t accept that.\nThey loved neobanks for UX not for repeating identity checks inside the same app.\n\nThis is the real blocker for scaling the stablecoin economy.\n\nThe solution is obvious:\nSeamless, compliant KYC re-usability\n\nThat’s exactly where idOS comes in.\nIt’s the beachhead into the massive onboarding, verification, and compliance market built for Web3 scale.\n\nRevenue model is simple and aligned:\n• Protocol fees\n• Service fees\n\nFix the identity layer → unlock composability → unlock growth.\n\nThis is infrastructure. And it’s overdue with @idOS_network",

Rivals has them with 5 5⭐️s which is extremely difficult to do in modern recruiting. 2 5 ⭐️wide receivers coming in after losing the best WR coach/recruiter in the country is also incredible. Sam Greer is a 6'6.5 Tackle that easily could and should have been a 5 star as well, sits currently around #50 overall. Blaine Bradford was also a five star early on in the cycle and think he can reach that caliber on the field. Emmanuel Ruffin is a force on the D-Line. Maxwell Rielly is a discipline and strong guard/ tackle with good feet. Legend Bey is as explosive as his name sounds. Brock Boyd will get behind your defender and is catching it every time. I love this 2026 class. Started slow but finished so strong.",
