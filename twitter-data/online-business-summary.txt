I just launched my first iOS app. Not my first startup. Not my first failure. But the first thing i truly built end-to-end on my own.

Returns are not a logistics problem.
They’re a confidence problem.
Customers don’t return because they’re careless.
They return because they never saw themselves in the outfit.
Ecommerce blaming customers?

Lesson from building AI support: Your customers don't care if it's AI or human. They just want their answer in under 2 minutes.

90% ticket auto-resolution isn't magic. It's just really good pattern matching. #BuildInPublic

Reminder to myself:

I'm not competing with apps that have millions of users.

I'm competing with the version of me from yesterday.

5 apps shipped.
5 more lessons learned.

That's progress.

I spent 5 years building a SaaS.

The result?

2 customers.

1 was me. The other churned after the first month.

Here is the brutal truth about the "Build it and they will come" fallacy 🧵👇

Talking about what I build? Not really.

Trying to break that pattern, so today I launched a side project on Product Hunt

Part product, part personal experiment

if you think that going viral is the solution to your 0 mrr life, then think again

viral = views, not sales

this post got 3.7m views

Real talk:

My apps aren't going viral.
Downloads are slow.
Revenue is... well, let's not talk about it 😅

But I'm still here because:

Building is fun.
Learning is valuable.
One user is better than zero.

Early days. Long game.

Only 0.07% of your followers are your customers/users.
~1.4k followers = 1 customer.

Yet I see 100k+ accounts only making $2k while 5k accounts pull $10k MRR 

Chasing followers is the fastest way to stay broke.

📱 Building apps people actually use
💰 Revenue = freedom

Hey #BuildInPublic community! 🌟

Navigating the world of product development and community engagement often feels like juggling flaming swords while riding a unicycle. 🎪 But here's a thought: Understanding what our customers truly want can simplify those balancing acts!

Are we truly doing the right thing by our customers, or are we getting lost in the allure of new features just because they're easy to develop? It's crucial to stay grounded in what adds real value, rather than getting swept up in a whirlwind of possibilities.

Have you tried community-voting or sharing a public roadmap? Honest timelines can build trust, and engaging with your community can lead to a more focused and efficient development process.

Curious to hear how you've tackled these challenges! Let's share some best practices. 💬
