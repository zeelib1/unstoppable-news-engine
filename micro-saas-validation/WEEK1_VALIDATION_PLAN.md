## ✅ Validation Success Criteria

### Strong Signals (Proceed to MVP)
- ✅ 25+ waitlist signups in 7 days
- ✅ 50%+ interview subjects say "I'd pay for this"
- ✅ Average willingness to pay ≥ $29/month
- ✅ People asking "when can I use it?"
- ✅ Specific pain points identified
- ✅ At least 3 platforms requested (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)

### Weak Signals (Pivot or Iterate)
- ⚠️ <10 waitlist signups after promotion
- ⚠️ Willingness to pay <$20/month
- ⚠️ "Nice to have" but not urgent
- ⚠️ People already happy with Buffer/Hootsuite
- ⚠️ No clear target audience emerges

### Red Flags (Stop or Pivot to Different Niche)
- 🚫 0-5 signups after aggressive promotion
- 🚫 "I wouldn't pay for this"
- 🚫 Existing solutions are "good enough"
- 🚫 Market too small (can't find target users)

---

## 🎯 Decision Points

**After Day 4 (Interviews complete):**
- **If 50%+ positive:** Continue to landing page
- **If <30% positive:** Pivot niche or pain point
- **If unclear:** Do 10 more interviews in different audience

**After Day 7 (Landing page week complete):**
- **25+ signups:** ✅ VALIDATED - Start Week 2 MVP development
- **10-24 signups:** Maybe - Extend validation 1 more week
- **<10 signups:** ⚠️ PIVOT - Try different niche or pain point

## 💡 Tips for Success

**Customer Interviews:**
- Be genuinely curious, not salesy
- Ask "why" 3 times to dig deeper
- Listen more than you talk
- Record conversations (with permission)
- Focus on pain, not your solution

**Landing Page:**
- Focus on the problem, not features
- Use customer quotes from interviews
- Clear call-to-action (email capture)
- Show pricing (builds trust)
- Launch special (50% off creates urgency)

**Community Engagement:**
- Be helpful, not promotional
- Share learnings, not just your product
- Ask questions, gather insights
- Build relationships (long-term thinking)

**Tracking:**
- Document everything (you'll forget)
- Look for patterns in interviews
- Note exact quotes for copy
- Track where signups come from

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building before validating** ❌
   - You're doing this right by validating first!

2. **Asking "would you use this?"** ❌
   - Everyone says yes. Ask "would you pay?"

3. **Talking to friends/family** ❌
   - They lie to be nice. Talk to strangers.

4. **Ignoring weak signals** ❌
   - If <10 signups, don't force it. Pivot.

5. **Skipping interviews** ❌
   - Landing page signups ≠ revenue
   - Conversations reveal truth

6. **Not documenting** ❌
   - Take notes. You'll need quotes for copy.
