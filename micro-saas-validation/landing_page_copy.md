### Problem Section

**Headline:**
```
You're Wasting Hours Every Week
```

**3 Pain Points:**

**1. 🕐 Time Drain**
```
Logging into 5+ platforms, copying content, adjusting for character limits,
adding platform-specific hashtags. 30 minutes per post, multiple times per day.
```

**2. 😫 Platform Fatigue**
```
Twitter has threads. LinkedIn needs line breaks. Bluesky handles @ mentions 
differently. Each platform has its own quirks. You're juggling 5 different UIs.
```

**3. 📉 Inconsistent Posting**
```
You post to Twitter daily but forget LinkedIn for weeks. You know you should 
be on Bluesky and Threads, but who has time? Your reach suffers.
```

---

### Solution Section

**Headline:**
```
One Post. Five Platforms. Zero Headache.
```

**3 Benefits:**

**1. ⚡ 10x Faster**
```
Write your post once. Click publish. Done. What took 30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.
```

**2. 🎯 Smart Formatting**
```
Automatically adapts content for each platform. Handles character limits, 
line breaks, hashtags, and @ mentions. Looks native everywhere.
```
*Icon: Magic wand or checkmark*

**3. 📈 Consistent Presence**
```
Be everywhere your audience is. Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon.
No more forgotten platforms. Maximum reach, minimum effort.

### FAQ Section

**Headline:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**Q1: How is this different from Buffer or Hootsuite?**
```
A: We focus on newer platforms they don't support well (Bluesky, Threads, 
Mastodon) and have better smart formatting. Plus, we're 50-70% cheaper.
```

**Q2: Do I need to connect all 5 platforms?**
```
A: Nope! Connect only the platforms you use. Even if it's just 2, you'll 
save time. Most users connect 3-5 platforms.
```

**Q3: What about Instagram?**
```
A: Instagram's API restrictions make full automation challenging. We're 
exploring options for future integration. For now, we focus on platforms 
with open APIs.
```

**Q4: Can I schedule posts in advance?**
```
A: Yes! Pro plan includes scheduled posting. Queue up content and let it 
publish automatically.
```

**Q5: What if I don't like it?**
```
A: 30-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked. Plus, you can cancel 
anytime. We're confident you'll love it.
```

**Q6: When will this launch?**
```
A: We're starting development this week. Beta testing in 3-4 weeks. Public 
launch in 6 weeks. Waitlist gets first access.

## 🚀 Launch Day Copy

**Tweet:**
```
I'm building a tool to solve my own problem: manually posting to Twitter, 
LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon is a time sink.

One click. Five platforms. Done.

**Reddit Post (r/SideProject):**
```
Title: [Feedback] Tool to post to 5 social platforms with one click

Hey everyone! I waste ~10 hours/week copying posts between Twitter, LinkedIn, 
Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon. Figured others have the same problem.

Building a simple tool: Write once, publish everywhere. Smart formatting for 
each platform's quirks.

Looking for feedback on the landing page and whether this solves a real problem 
for you: [Link]

**Indie Hackers Post:**
```
Title: Validating: Cross-platform social media posting tool

**The Problem:**
As an indie hacker, I should be posting on Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, etc. 
But manually copying content to 5 platforms takes 30min per post. I skip it.

**The Solution:**
Tool that posts to all platforms with one click. Handles character limits, 
formatting, all the platform-specific stuff.

**Validation So Far:**
- 15 customer interviews
- Average willingness to pay: $40/month
- Landing page: [link]

**Question for IH:**
1. Do you have this problem?
2. Which platforms matter most to you?
3. What would you pay?

Thanks for any feedback!

## 💡 Copy Tips

**What works:**
✅ Specific numbers ("10 hours/week" not "lots of time")
✅ Clear pain points readers recognize
✅ Benefits, not features ("Save time" not "Has scheduling")
✅ Social proof (even if just "50+ on waitlist")
✅ Urgency without being pushy ("First 100 get 50% off")

**What doesn't work:**
❌ Vague claims ("Revolutionary tool")
❌ Feature lists without benefits
❌ Too much text (keep it scannable)
❌ No clear CTA
❌ Asking for money before showing value
