### Tweet Thread (Day 1 - Problem Awareness)

```
1/ I waste 10+ hours every week doing something incredibly stupid:

Manually posting the same content to Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon.

There has to be a better way. 🧵

2/ Here's what it looks like:

- Write a thread on Twitter
- Copy/paste to LinkedIn (add line breaks)
- Reformat for Bluesky (different @ mention syntax)
- Adjust for Threads (different character limits)
- Post on Mastodon (yet another UI)

30 minutes per post. Multiple times per day. 😫

3/ Tools like Buffer and Hootsuite exist, but:

- Don't support new platforms (Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon)
- Expensive ($50-99/month for features I need)
- Complex UIs built for social media managers, not indie hackers

4/ So I'm building something simpler:

✅ One click → posts to all 5 platforms
✅ Smart formatting (handles character limits, hashtags, @mentions)
✅ Works with the new platforms big tools ignore
✅ Affordable ($29/month, not $99)

5/ Early validation:

Talked to 20 founders/creators.
15 said "I'd pay for this"
Average willingness to pay: $40/month

Building in public starting this week.

6/ If you waste time cross-posting to multiple platforms, I'm building this for you.

### r/SideProject Post

```markdown
**Title:** [Feedback] Social media cross-posting tool - one click to 5 platforms

**Body:**

Hey everyone!

**The Problem I'm Solving:**

I spend ~10 hours per week manually posting the same content to:
- Twitter
- LinkedIn  
- Bluesky
- Threads
- Mastodon

Each platform has different character limits, formatting requirements, and UIs. It's exhausting.

**What I'm Building:**

A simple tool where you:
1. Write your post once
2. Click publish
3. It posts to all platforms automatically, handling character limits and formatting

**Validation So Far:**

- 20 customer interviews with founders/creators
- 15/20 said they'd pay for this
- Average willingness to pay: $35-50/month

**Landing Page:**
[Link to your landing page]

**Questions for r/SideProject:**

1. Do you have this problem? Which platforms do you post to?
2. What would you pay for this? (Honest feedback only)
3. What features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?

### r/entrepreneur Post

```markdown
**Title:** How do you handle cross-posting to multiple social platforms?

**Body:**

Fellow entrepreneurs,

Quick question: How much time do you spend posting the same content across Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.?

I'm spending 10+ hours/week on this and it's killing my productivity. I should be building my business, not fighting with 5 different social media UIs.

**Current process:**
- Write content
- Log into Twitter, post
- Log into LinkedIn, reformat (line breaks are different)
- Log into Bluesky, reformat (@mentions work differently)  
- Repeat for Threads, Mastodon, etc.

**What I tried:**
- Buffer/Hootsuite - Don't support newer platforms (Bluesky, Threads)
- Manual posting - Takes forever
- Ignoring some platforms - Missing audience

**Considering building:**
Simple tool: Write once → Click publish → Posts everywhere with smart formatting

**Questions:**

1. Do you have this problem?
2. What's your current solution?
3. Would you pay for a tool that solves this? How much?

Not trying to sell anything, genuinely trying to understand if this is a real problem worth solving.

Appreciate any insights!
```

### r/SaaS Post

```markdown
**Title:** Validating a micro-SaaS idea: Cross-platform social media posting

**Body:**

**Problem:** 
Content creators/founders waste 5-10 hours/week manually posting to multiple social platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon)

**Solution:**
One-click cross-posting tool with smart formatting for each platform

**Market Research:**
- 20 customer interviews (indie hackers, content creators, small business owners)
- 75% have the problem (15/20)
- 75% of those would pay (11.25/15)
- Average willingness to pay: $35-50/month
- Pain level: 7-8/10

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Buffer/Hootsuite exist but don't support new platforms well
- Pricing gap: They charge $50-99/mo, we could do $29-79

**Landing page (live):**
[Link]

25+ waitlist signups in first 48 hours

**Questions for r/SaaS:**

1. Pricing strategy: $29 (Starter) / $79 (Pro) too low/high?
2. Go-to-market: Build audience first or launch to cold traffic?
3. Red flags I'm missing?

Building this as a solo founder. Any advice appreciated!

## 🚀 Indie Hackers

### Main Post (Validation Stage)

```markdown
**Title:** 20 customer interviews → Validating social media cross-posting tool

**Body:**

Hey IH! 👋

**The Journey So Far:**

I wasted 10 hours last week manually posting the same content to Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon. Each platform has different quirks (character limits, formatting, @mentions).

Figured I couldn't be the only one with this problem.

**Validation:**

Spent the last week doing customer interviews:
- **Interviewed:** 20 people (indie hackers, creators, small biz owners)
- **Have the problem:** 15/20 (75%)
- **Would pay:** 11/15 (73%)
- **Avg willingness to pay:** $35-50/month
- **Pain level:** 7-8/10

**Key Quote:**
> "I know I should be on Bluesky and Threads but I literally don't have time to post everywhere. This would be a game-changer." — Solo founder

**What I'm Building:**

Simple cross-posting tool:
1. Write once
2. Click publish  
3. Posts to all platforms with smart formatting

Platforms: Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon
(Focusing on ones Buffer/Hootsuite don't support well)

**Landing Page:**
[Link]

Early supporters get 50% off for life. Already at 30 waitlist signups.

**Next Steps:**

Starting development this week. Goal: MVP in 2 weeks, beta testing in 3 weeks.

**Questions for IH:**

1. Do you have this problem? Which platforms do you post to?
2. What features are must-haves?
3. What would make you switch from current solution (manual or Buffer)?

Building in public! Will share updates as I ship.

Thanks for reading! 🙏

### Milestone Update Post

```markdown
**Title:** [Update] 50 waitlist signups → Starting development

**Body:**

Quick update on the social media cross-posting tool I'm validating:

**Week 1 Results:**
- ✅ 20 customer interviews completed
- ✅ 50+ waitlist signups  
- ✅ Strong validation signals (75% would pay)
- ✅ Clear pain points identified

**Decision: Building it! 🚀**

**Development Plan:**

Week 2: MVP (Next.js, Twitter/LinkedIn/Bluesky integration)
Week 3: Beta testing with waitlist
Week 4: Public launch

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js + TypeScript (frontend)
- Railway (hosting)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Stripe (payments)

**Building with AI assistance:**
- Cursor (AI code editor)
- Claude (architecture/debugging)
- v0.dev (UI components)

Targeting 4 weeks to first revenue instead of traditional 12 weeks.

**Lessons So Far:**

1. Customer interviews >>> Assumptions
2. Talk to 20+ people before building anything
3. "Would you pay?" ≠ "Would you use?" (Ask the hard question)
4. Build landing page before product (validates demand)

**Following along:**

I'll post weekly updates here. If you're interested in early access or just want to follow the journey, landing page: [link]

Always happy to chat if you have questions about the validation process!

### Professional Announcement

```markdown
I'm building a solution to a problem that's been driving me crazy: cross-posting to multiple social platforms.

As a [founder/creator/marketer], I post on Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon. Each platform has different:
• Character limits
• Formatting requirements  
• Hashtag conventions
• @mention syntax

Manually posting takes 10+ hours per week. Time I should spend on [building/creating/strategy].

After interviewing 20 people in similar situations, I found 75% have this exact problem.

So I'm building a simple tool:
→ Write once
→ Click publish
→ Posts to all platforms with smart formatting

Beta testing starts in 3 weeks. Early access available: [link]

## 📝 Personal Blog Post

```markdown
**Title:** I Spent 10 Hours This Week Doing Something Incredibly Stupid

**Intro:**

I manually copied and pasted the same content across Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon. Five different platforms. Five different UIs. Five different sets of formatting rules.

10 hours I'll never get back.

And I'll probably do it again next week because "you need to be on social media to grow your audience."

Unless... I build a better solution.

**The Problem:**

As an indie hacker, I know I should be posting on multiple platforms. Different audiences hang out in different places:
- Twitter: Tech community  
- LinkedIn: Professional network
- Bluesky: Early adopter crowd
- Threads: Instagram overflow
- Mastodon: Decentralization enthusiasts

But manually posting to all of them is exhausting:
- Twitter: 280 character limit, threads
- LinkedIn: Needs line breaks for readability
- Bluesky: Different @mention syntax
- Threads: Yet another character limit
- Mastodon: Instance-specific quirks

**Current Solutions Suck:**

Buffer and Hootsuite exist, but:
1. Don't support newer platforms well (Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon)
2. Designed for social media managers with $99/month budgets
3. Complex UIs for scheduling weeks in advance (I just want to post NOW)

**So I'm Building Something Better:**

Simple cross-posting tool for indie hackers:
- Write once
- Click publish
- Done

Smart formatting handles all the platform-specific stuff automatically.

**Validation:**

Before writing a line of code, I talked to 20 people (founders, creators, small business owners).

Results:
- 15/20 have this problem (75%)
- 11/15 would pay for a solution (73%)
- Average willingness to pay: $35-50/month

That's enough validation to start building.

**The Plan:**

Week 1: Validate (✅ Done - you're reading this)
Week 2: Build MVP (Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky integration)
Week 3: Beta test with waitlist
Week 4: Public launch

Using AI tools (Cursor, Claude, v0.dev) to build 10x faster than traditional development.

**Building in Public:**

I'll document the journey:
- Week 1: This post (validation)
- Week 2: Technical architecture decisions
- Week 3: Beta testing learnings
- Week 4: Launch results
