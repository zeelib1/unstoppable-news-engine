## Script 1: Content Creators / Indie Hackers

**Opening (1 min)**
```
Hi [Name], thanks for taking time to chat!

I'm researching how people manage their social media presence, and I'd love to learn about your workflow. No sales pitch, just genuinely curious about your process.

Sound good?
```

**Discovery Questions (10 min)**

1. **Current workflow:**
   "Walk me through how you currently share content across social media. Like if you write a blog post, what's your process for promoting it?"

2. **Time investment:**
   "How much time would you say you spend on social media posting per week? Just the posting itself, not creating content."

3. **Pain points:**
   "What's the most annoying part of that process?"

4. **Platforms:**
   "Which platforms do you post to? (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)"
   "Are there any new platforms you want to be on but haven't had time? (Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon?)"

5. **Current tools:**
   "Do you use any tools to help with this? Buffer, Hootsuite, etc.?"
   "What do you like/dislike about them?"

6. **Ideal solution:**
   "If you could wave a magic wand, what would make this easier?"

7. **Cross-posting:**
   "Do you post the same content to multiple platforms, or customize for each?"
   "If you customize, what's different? (Character limits, hashtags, etc.)"

**Validation Questions (3 min)**

8. **Problem severity:**
   "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this problem for you?
   1 = minor annoyance, 10 = losing sleep over it"

9. **Current spend:**
   "Are you currently paying for any social media tools? How much per month?"

10. **Willingness to pay:**
    "If there was a tool that could post to Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon with ONE click, and handled character limits automatically, what would that be worth to you per month?"
    
    (If they hesitate: "Just ballpark - $10? $30? $50? $100?")

11. **Decision trigger:**
    "What would make you switch from your current setup to something new?"

12. **Urgency:**
    "If I built this, how soon would you want to start using it?
    - This week
    - This month
    - When I have time (low priority)
    - Not sure"

**Closing (1 min)**

13. **Waitlist:**
    "I'm considering building this. If I did, would you be interested in early access at 50% off the regular price?"
    
    (If yes: "Great! Can I grab your email to keep you posted?")

14. **Referrals:**
    "Do you know anyone else who deals with this same pain? Could you intro me?"

**End:**
"This was super helpful, thank you! I'll keep you posted as I make progress."

## Customization

Feel free to adapt these scripts! Best interviews feel like natural conversations, not interrogations.

**Keep:**
- Pain point questions
- Willingness to pay questions
- Waitlist ask

**Adapt:**
- Your personality/style
- Audience-specific language
- Follow interesting tangents

---

**Remember:** The goal is to learn if people will **pay** for this, not if they think it's cool.

Good luck! 🚀
