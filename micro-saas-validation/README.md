## ⚠️ If Validation Fails

**Don't give up! Pivot strategically:**

**If signups low (<10) but interviews positive:**
- → Improve landing page copy
- → Promote harder (more communities)
- → Extend validation 1 week

**If interviews show weak interest:**
- → Try different niche (B2B vs B2C)
- → Solve different pain point
- → Interview different audience

**If both low:**
- → Return to research phase
- → Interview 20 more people in different market
- → Consider different product idea

**Learnings to take forward:**
- ✅ You know how to validate now
- ✅ You have interview scripts
- ✅ You know which communities to tap
- ✅ Next idea will be faster to validate

- ✅ Focus on problem, not features
- ✅ Show pricing (builds trust)
- ✅ Use customer quotes
- ✅ Clear CTA (email capture)
- ✅ Launch special (creates urgency)

**Community Posting:**
- ✅ Provide value, don't just promote

## 🎯 Your Week 1 Goal

**Get to 25 waitlist signups**

That proves:

- ✅ Time to build the MVP

**If you hit 25+ signups:**
→ You're validated
→ Start Week 2 (MVP development)
→ Email waitlist with update
→ Build with confidence

**If you don't:**
→ Analyze why (interviews or promotion?)
→ Pivot intelligently
→ Try again with learnings
