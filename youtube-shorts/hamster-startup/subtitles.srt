1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, listen up.
I've been running on this wheel for three years.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
That's longer than most startups survive.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
You want to know the secret?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's not about the destination.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,500
It's about consistent daily effort

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,000
that looks completely pointless
to outside observers.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Everyone's obsessed with "disruption"
and "unicorn valuations."

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Meanwhile, I'm here optimizing
my seed storage strategy.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
That's customer retention, baby.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,000
You know what kills startups?
Overthinking. Analysis paralysis.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,500
Me? I see a sunflower seed,
I take action.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,000
No three-hour strategy meeting.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Your "minimum viable product"?
I built mine in 30 seconds.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a pile of bedding in the corner.
Customers love it.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
And pivoting?
I pivot 47 times per minute on this wheel.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
That's agility.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
So here's my advice:
Stop reading startup blogs.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Start running in circles
until something works.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Your hamster has spoken.
