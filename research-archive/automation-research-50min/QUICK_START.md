## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: Basic understanding helps, but AI (Cursor + Claude) writes 80% of code. You review & test.

**Q: What if I can't get 25 waitlist signups?**
A: Try different niche or pain point. Don't build until validated.

**Q: Can I really build this in 4-6 weeks?**
A: Yes, with AI tools. Bolt.new can generate full MVP in hours. You refine.

**Q: What if competitors already exist?**
A: Focus on underserved platforms (Bluesky, Mastodon) and better UX.
