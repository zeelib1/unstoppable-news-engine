# AskFiles Implementation Methodology

**Created:** 2026-01-28 15:35 CET  
**Purpose:** Define how we build, validate, and ship

---

## Current Reality: What I Actually Have

### Available Tools
```
✅ read/write - File manipulation
✅ exec - Command execution (but php/composer not installed on this system)
✅ sessions_spawn - Can create sub-agents for parallel work
✅ web_search/web_fetch - Research and documentation
✅ memory_search/memory_get - Context retrieval
```

### What I DON'T Have
```
❌ Specialized implementation agents (backend-builder, frontend-builder, tester)
❌ Automated CI/CD integration
❌ Automated test runners
❌ Code review agents
❌ Quality gates
```

### Reality Check
I'm **one agent** with standard tools. I can:
- Write code files
- Execute commands (when tools are installed)
- Spawn sub-agents (but they're just other Claude instances, not specialized)
- Document and explain

I **cannot**:
- Automatically validate code quality
- Run tests in parallel
- Auto-deploy with quality gates
- Self-review code architecture

## The Gap: What We Need

For a **proper** implementation workflow, we'd want:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              IDEAL WORKFLOW (What We Need)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│  1. Architect Agent                                     │
│     → Designs structure, reviews PRs                    │
│                                                         │
│  2. Backend Builder Agent                               │
│     → Writes Laravel code, migrations, services         │
│                                                         │
│  3. Frontend Builder Agent                              │
│     → Writes Nuxt components, pages, composables        │
│                                                         │
│  4. Test Agent                                          │
│     → Writes + runs PHPUnit, Vitest, Playwright         │
│                                                         │
│  5. Quality Gate                                        │
│     → Validates: tests pass, linting, types, security   │
│                                                         │
│  6. Deployment Agent                                    │
│     → Handles staging → prod pipeline                   │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**We don't have this.** Yet.

## What We CAN Do: Pragmatic Approach

Given current limitations, here's the **realistic workflow**:

### Option A: Manual Implementation with You (Current)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              MANUAL WORKFLOW                         │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│  Step 1: I write code                               │
│  Step 2: I show you                                 │
│  Step 3: You review (10-20 seconds)                 │
│  Step 4: You say "ship it" or "fix X"               │
│  Step 5: I commit + push                            │
│  Step 6: Repeat                                     │
│                                                      │
│  Quality Control: YOUR EYES 👀                       │
│                                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- Fast feedback loop
- You maintain control
- Lightweight (no infra setup)

**Cons:**
- You're the quality gate (requires your time)
- No automated testing
- Manual validation

---

### Option B: Sub-Agent Parallel Work (Experimental)

I can use `sessions_spawn` to create parallel workers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         SUB-AGENT PARALLEL WORKFLOW                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│  Main (Me):                                          │
│    → Orchestrates, reviews, merges                  │
│                                                      │
│  Sub-Agent 1:                                        │
│    → Build backend migrations (#103-104)            │
│                                                      │
│  Sub-Agent 2:                                        │
│    → Build services (#105-106)                      │
│                                                      │
│  Sub-Agent 3:                                        │
│    → Build API endpoints (#107-108)                 │
│                                                      │
│  When done:                                          │
│    → Each pings me                                  │
│    → I review + integrate                           │
│    → You validate final result                      │
│                                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- Faster (3x parallel work)
- I review before showing you
- Still lightweight

**Cons:**
- Sub-agents can make mistakes
- I need to QA their work
- More complex coordination

### Option C: Traditional Dev Setup (Best Quality)

If we install proper dev tools:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW                         │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│  1. Install PHP, Composer, Node, pnpm               │
│  2. I write code                                    │
│  3. I run tests locally                             │
│  4. I run linters                                   │
│  5. I show you green builds                         │
│  6. You validate                                    │
│  7. CI/CD runs on push                              │
│                                                      │
│  Quality: Automated + Manual                        │
│                                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- Proper quality gates
- Tests catch bugs before you see them
- Industry standard

**Cons:**
- Setup time (30-60 minutes)
- Slower per-issue cycle
- Heavier (but more reliable)

---

## My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

**For AskFiles MVP:**

### Phase 1: Fast Iteration (Today)
1. **Setup environment** (install PHP, Composer, Node)
2. **Manual workflow** (Option A)
   - I write code
   - Show you snippets
   - You quick-review
   - Ship fast

**Why:** Get to working product fastest

### Phase 2: Quality Layer (Tomorrow)
1. **Add testing** (write tests as we go)
2. **Run tests** before showing you
3. **CI/CD** on GitHub Actions

**Why:** Build confidence as we scale

---

## Quality Validation: What I Actually Do

### Current Process (Honest)

**When writing code:**
```
1. Read requirements (issue description)
2. Check existing code patterns
3. Write implementation
4. Mental syntax check (but can't run it)
5. Show you
6. Hope it works 😅
```

**What I should be doing:**
```
1. Read requirements
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Write implementation
4. Run tests
5. Run linters
6. Show you green build
7. Commit with confidence
```

**The gap:** No runtime validation before showing you.

## Immediate Action: Install Dev Tools

Let me check what's needed:

```bash
# Backend (Laravel)
- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- SQLite

# Frontend (Nuxt)
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

# Both installed on server? Let me verify...
```

---

## Proposed Workflow for TODAY

### 1. Environment Setup (30 min)
```
[ ] Install PHP 8.2
[ ] Install Composer
[ ] Install Node 22
[ ] Install pnpm
[ ] Test: php artisan --version
[ ] Test: pnpm --version
```

### 2. Per-Issue Workflow (10-30 min each)
```
For each issue (#103-108):

1. I implement
2. I test locally (php artisan test, pnpm test)
3. I show you:
   - Code snippet
   - Test output (green)
   - Quick demo
4. You approve or request changes
5. I commit + push
6. Move to next issue
```

### 3. Integration Testing (after all issues)
```
1. Run full test suite
2. Manual E2E test (upload PDF → search)
3. You validate user flow
4. Deploy to production
```

---

## Your Decision Needed

Pick your speed vs quality tradeoff:

### A) 🚀 Speed Mode (4-6 hours to MVP)
- Skip environment setup
- I write code directly
- You review by reading
- No tests run until deploy
- **Risk:** Bugs found in production

### B) ⚖️ Balanced Mode (6-8 hours to MVP)
- Install dev tools (30 min)
- I write + test locally
- Show you green builds
- **Risk:** Minimal, caught early

### C) 🛡️ Quality Mode (8-12 hours to MVP)
- Full TDD (tests first)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Multiple review passes
- **Risk:** Nearly zero, but slower

---

## My Honest Recommendation

**Go with B (Balanced).**

Reasoning:
1. 30 minutes to install tools is worth it
2. I can catch syntax errors before showing you
3. You review less broken code
4. End result is more stable
5. Still ship tonight

**Tradeoff:** 1-2 hours slower, but 10x less debugging.

---

## Next Step

**You tell me:**
1. Which workflow? (A/B/C)
2. Should I install PHP/Composer/Node first?
3. Or just start writing code and hope it works?

I'll document the decision in our project log.
