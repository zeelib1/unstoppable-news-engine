# Implementation Tracking Structure

**Created:** 2026-01-28 16:05 CET  
**Purpose:** Organize plans, implementations, and validations

## What Goes Where

### Plans (`3.x - Implementation/plans/`)
**Format:** `{issue-number}-{short-name}-plan.md`

**Contains:**
- Issue details
- Files to create/modify
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Dependencies and risks
- Testing strategy
- Acceptance criteria

**Example:** `103-knowledge-bases-plan.md`

**When Created:** After `/plan 103` command, before coding

---

### Validations (`3.x - Implementation/validations/`)
**Format:** `{issue-number}-validation.md`

**Contains:**
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Coverage percentage
- Code review findings
- Manual testing results
- Screenshots (if UI)
- Time spent

**Example:** `103-validation.md`

**When Created:** After `/verify 103` command, before commit

---

### Retrospectives (`3.x - Implementation/retrospectives/`)
**Format:** `{milestone}-retrospective.md`

**Contains:**
- What went well
- What went wrong
- Lessons learned
- Process improvements
- Time estimates vs actual

**Example:** `backend-retrospective.md` (after all 6 backend issues)

**When Created:** After completing a milestone (backend, frontend, deployment)

---

## Workflow with Documentation

### Issue #103 Example

```
1. Plan Phase
   ├─ Run: /plan 103
   ├─ Generate: 3.1-plans/103-knowledge-bases-plan.md
   ├─ Upload to Drive
   └─ YOU REVIEW ✋ Approve or request changes

2. Implementation Phase
   ├─ Run: /tdd 103
   ├─ Write tests (RED)
   ├─ Implement code (GREEN)
   ├─ Refactor (IMPROVE)
   └─ Show you working code

3. Review Phase
   ├─ Run: /code-review
   └─ Check for security/quality issues

4. Verification Phase
   ├─ Run: /verify
   ├─ Generate: 3.2-validations/103-validation.md
   ├─ Upload to Drive
   └─ YOU REVIEW ✋ Validate test results

5. Commit Phase
   ├─ git commit with proper message
   ├─ Push to GitHub
   └─ Issue #103 closed ✅
```

---

## Automation

### After `/plan` Command
```
1. Generate plan markdown
2. Save to: /root/clawd/3.1-plans/{issue}-plan.md
3. Upload to: gdrive:AskFiles Project/3.x - Implementation/plans/
4. Show you the plan
5. Wait for approval
```

### After `/verify` Command
```
1. Run all tests
2. Generate validation report
3. Save to: /root/clawd/3.2-validations/{issue}-validation.md
4. Upload to: gdrive:AskFiles Project/3.x - Implementation/validations/
5. Show you results
6. If all green → proceed to commit
```

## Benefits

### For You
- **Visibility:** See what's happening at each step
- **Control:** Approve plans before code is written
- **Accountability:** See test results before code is committed
- **Learning:** Review retrospectives to improve process

### For Future You
- **History:** Know why decisions were made
- **Estimates:** Compare planned vs actual time
- **Patterns:** Identify what works (and what doesn't)
- **Onboarding:** New team members can read the journey

## Folder Creation

Should I create the Drive folders now?

```
3.x - Implementation/
├── plans/
├── validations/
└── retrospectives/
```

**Your call:** Create now, or wait until first `/plan` command?

---

## Alternative: Single Log File

If you prefer simpler:

**Option B:**
```
3.0-implementation-log.md  ← Single file, all plans appended

Format:
---
## Issue #103: Knowledge Bases Migration
Date: 2026-01-28
Status: Planned → Implemented → Verified → Committed

### Plan
[plan content]

### Validation
[test results]

### Time
Planned: 15 min
Actual: 18 min

---
## Issue #104: Document Chunks Migration
...
```

**Pros:** One file, chronological, easy to search  
**Cons:** Gets long (but that's okay)

---

## My Recommendation

**Hybrid approach:**

1. **Detailed plans** → Individual files in `plans/` folder
2. **Summary log** → `3.0-implementation-log.md` with links
3. **Validations** → Individual files in `validations/` folder
4. **Retrospectives** → One file per milestone

**Result:** Detailed when needed, summary for quick reference

---

**Your decision:** Which structure do you prefer?
1. Full folders (plans/, validations/, retrospectives/)
2. Single log file (simpler)
3. Hybrid (summary + detailed files)
