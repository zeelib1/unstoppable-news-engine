## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-28 | Product: Knowledge Base vs Blog | KB has unique value prop, blog is commodity |
| 2026-01-28 | Domain: askfiles.io | Broader than PDF, clear action verb |
| 2026-01-28 | Vector DB: Qdrant self-hosted | No vendor lock-in, free, good performance |
| 2026-01-28 | Embeddings: OpenAI | Industry standard, cheap ($0.02/1M), reliable |
| 2026-01-28 | MVP Strategy: No auth | Shareable links only, faster launch |
| 2026-01-28 | Hosting: Same server | Sufficient resources, cost-effective |

## Budget Tracker

| Item | Cost | Frequency | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| askfiles.io domain | €25 | Annual | ✅ Paid |
| Server hosting | ~€20-40 | Monthly | ✅ Existing |
| OpenAI API credits | $5-10 | One-time start | ⏳ Pending |
| Future: SSL | $0 | N/A | Caddy auto-SSL |

**Total startup cost:** ~€30 + $10 = ~€40 (~$43)
